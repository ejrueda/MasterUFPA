housekeeping: Any constitutive gene that is transcribed at a relatively constant
              level across many or all known conditions. Such a gene's products
              typically serve functions critical to the maintenance of the cell.
              It is generally assumed that their expression is unaffected by
              experimental conditions.


Rerefence genes:  Reference genes are expressed in all cells of an organism
                  under normal and patho-physiological conditions. Although
                  some housekeeping genes (such as LDHA,[4] NONO,[4] PGK1[4]
                  and PPIH,[4]) are expressed at relatively constant levels in
                  most non-pathological situations, other housekeeping genes may
                  vary depending on experimental conditions.
